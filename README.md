# DNA_Splicing

This is a project that has potential application in genetics and vaccine developement. See the ipython notebook for the complete code with results. 

Summary of the dataset:

-> This is a dataset of DNA sequences that define the boundaries between regions that are spliced out during protein creation (introns) or retained for protein creation (exons).

-> There are 3 classes: boundaries between exon and intron sequences (EI), boundaries between intron and exon sequences (IE), or sequences that are neither.

-> The dataset has 3190 examples of DNA sequences.

-> Each sequence is 60 base-pairs long.
